# MetallicWireMachine
Automation system for a metallic wire processing machine:

This Project was intended to help my cousin with his end of studies' project.

The automation system is built using the concept of Finite State Machines that serve as a manager that organizes a set of states and the transition between states.

The transitions is caused by the buttons being pressed either by the wire processing machine or the user. Transitions happen immediately.

Four states were used for this project:

* Standby (basic state): State 0
* Wire feeding: State 1
* Actuator down: State 2
* Actuator up: State 3
