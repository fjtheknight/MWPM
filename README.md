# MetallicWireMachine
Automation system for a metallic wire processing machine:

This Project was intended to help my cousin with his end of studies' project.

The automation system is built using the concept of Finite State Machines that serve as a manager that organizes a set of states and the transition between states.

The transitions is caused by the buttons being pressed either by the wire processing machine or the user. Transitions happen immediately.
